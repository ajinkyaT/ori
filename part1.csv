,1.5 tons,,"First things, Inverter AC also comes with Star Rating. Whenever buying an AC check for EER (Energy Efficient Ratio) which should be at-least 4.0 or above for high power savings. This is most recent and rare model I found on the Internet.After lots of research for my first Split AC. I found this great machine.Price: Costly.Power Efficient: Yes 4.3 EER.Looks: Sexy & Damn the digital Display is just elegant.The Remote shows its WiFi AC, can be controlled using a smart app but I didn't find any details on the Manuals or Website. But Bluestar is working on it as shared by Bluestar Installation Guy.Things to Note:Upgrading from Window to Split is lot of hassles & extra money.Window AC are very easy to Install with no extra cost.I bought this in Summer Season as there was an offer from Bluestar for Free Installation.Now, if you purchase, You will have to shed out Rs.1200/ for Installation. + If any Copper Coil or Insulation Tape or Stand or anything required extra with this.Bluestar outer model is very large even for 1.5 ton AC compared to other Split AC's. Make sure you have an extra space for placing the Outdoor Fan Cabinet.Anyways, I was not happy with Seller's Communication as I wanted to speak with him over the phone but he stick to Email Replies passing through Amazon as midator which took more time to get answers.",Good,Good Product!!!,i bought this product in nagpur...awesome cooling and energy efficient...good one,Mast,,,B01CY2QGA4," 47,590.00",Blue Star,"Blue Star BI-5CNHW18PAFU Split AC (1.5 Ton, 4.75 Star Rating, White, Copper): Amazon.in: Home & Kitchen",5 reviews,5 Star Rating,,,Remote Control,BI-5CNHW18PAFU,#279,"#2,78,223",White,,Split,4.8 out of 5 stars,230 Volts,http://www.amazon.in/Blue-Star-BI-5CNHW18PAFU-Rating-Copper/dp/B01CY2QGA4/ref=sr_1_215/255-0990334-3122366?ie=UTF8&qid=1485079627&s=kitchen&sr=1-215

Complained to voltas again and requested them replace the defective piece. Despite repeated complaints to voltas, second technician visited on 27 May ( 32 days after installation) and again wrote manufacturing fault on indoor as well as outdoor unit also this time which was tested then.

It is a very good product,1.5 tons,53 dB,It's one of the best AC in the market right now.

,1 tons,39 dB,"I bought Carrier AC after much deliberation and have looked at all other options. I have shortlisted Daikin, Carrier, Hitachi, O General and Mitsubishi only, as i want Full Copper Condenser unlike aluminium condenser in LG, Samsung, Voltas or Bluestar. Because of Copper Condenser, the cooling is very fast and effective. Also, looks wise as well as performance wise, the product is excellent. In terms of noise, Daikin ACs are the best though it is still comparable with Hitachi and much better than LG/Samsung/Voltas.Only issue I faced was with Installation, which took time and I have to pay Rs 1500 for installation and Rs 2000 for extra Copper pipe.",I purchase rs.35250.(3 month ago) Carrier 1.5 ton 5 star superior model it is a very good and nice cooling. display LED.. silent . I give five star selle for price. from-javedsaiyed (Nandasan) Gujarat.,"Amazing delivery by Amazon and ATS team. About the product it is good in terms of performance, long term usage especially during summer remains to be verified. Two things which have reduced the rating:a) The out door unit doesn't have a protection plastic cap or cover over the copper pipe inlets. This is strange as the unit has holes to fix the cover but no cover. The installation team confirmed that carrier doesn't provide the cover, this is unacceptable considering the cover is a basic small cost item and even the unbranded air conditioners provide the same.b) Installation team was competent , fast and clean, however they haven't yet sent the installation report or the invoice for the installation charges paid.

Good product. As described in the specifications.Inner unit's noise is negligible but outer unit produces noise.,1 tons,40 dB,"Really happy with the AC and quick installation by voltas.Its 1 month now and I can say that it is a good machine, less frills, both IDU and ODU are silent and cooling is perfect.The room size is 100 sq.ft. in Mumbai and it was installed in May 2016 - peak summer.I can't comment yet on Electric consumption, that is to be seen when electricity bill arrives from BEST.-----------Update:  It's been 4 months of use now and I think the AC is working perfect for my small room. The installation was quick and clean by Voltas just after few days of purchase from Amazon. Though it may be because I stay in Mumbai where service is usually good.Initially I was bit worried about AC's 3 star rating, but as it turns out, electricity bill was less than expected and it is quite acceptable when I compare it with my other room's 5 Star rated Voltas AC(which is 1.5 ton).There is no display on the remote but it doesn't feel cheap. The body of IDU and ODU feels nice and sturdy and both units are surprisingly silent.So far I am impressed with this Voltas AC, and I might update this review again after 1 year just to confirm if its performance remains same or has deteriorated.","pathetic AC I have purchased 2 and its not cooling at all even after 2 to 3 hrs of operation raised a complaint with voltas they came and this is what heyhave to say...""THEY ALSO WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF IT WAS A FIRST TIME CUSTOMER YOU WOULDNT KNOW ONLY COS I HAVE USED A BETTER PRODUCT I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. AND THIS VOLTAS AC CANNOT BE COMPARED TO BLUE STAR OR MITSIBISHI AC's."" SAD SAD SAD...never buy a voltas product","Voltas service is bad and unresponsive. They keep on sending messages about appointment for installation. No one turns up. After about ten days they turned up and took 7 hours to install. In order to shift a tube light, the installation guy demanded money. Finally they installed in a way that I could not open my window. In complaining voltas promptly sent some one to repair and rectify.  However I was stressed by daily follow up with voltas. It seems they give priority to installing ac's bought from offline retailers for whom installation is free as well.Now for the AC, I got it an incredible lightning price! (123lyb) AC for the price I paid is OK. No evidence of excess sound as some people are complaining. By the way there is difference in specifications between 123 lyi and lyb ( lyibis better with gold fins etc) All in all happy with the value proposition provided by AC, very unhappy with the voltas customer service. 4/5 for AC. 0/5 for voltas service.  Overall 2/5. If you buy, register a request with voltas on the day you order.",There is a loud noise from the AC from the day after installation. Feel regret for investing on this.,The product is good but somehow face issues with installation as the persons came from voltas were not well equipped and  trained.The installation was not upto the mark & i called them again to fix the issues.Otherwise product is good,Same problem.

Made room so dirt, didn't even bother to clean anything. I have photos as proof proof for all this. But, Amazon delivery has no problems. Worst kind of service from Voltas.

But the lightning sale was just too tempting, and i figured 'how bad can it really be?"" Bad decision. It's been pure and simple horrible! Its been 15 days since the purchase and i have not been able to use the AC even once. The first guy who came for the installation apparently left too much gas, causing ice formation in the indoor unit, which hence had to be kept switched off. 3 days later, someone came to resolve it, removed gas, and in the process not only made the AC completely non effective, but also broke the swing making it impossible for the flap to close. the call center rep assured me that he would get it checked on priority - but actually didn't note the problem at all! i just called up to ask the status of my complaint and have been pushed back a further 3 working days for resolution. Considering i've spent almost 40k of my hard earned cash on this piece of junk, i now wish i had gone with a tried and trusted brand instead. There is no escalation matrix, call center doesn't have a TL available for a chat, there are no mail ids to call, service center doesn't entertain calls - all you are left with is an ineffective call center rep, a text box to vent your frustrations online, and a broken AC. Hope you are stronger willed than I was - there are no free / discounted lunches, and if something is being sold at a heavy discount, it is quite likely that there is some problem with it.",Please do not buy... Amazon is misguiding customers by writing incorrect product description.Installation is not included. Voltas charges Rs 1500 for a very inefficient and untidy installation.Amazon mentions the product comes with a copper tube/compressor but the product comes with all aluminium which is a huge cost factor. Copper tube/compressors are always more durable and expensive than aluminium ones.,Wish there was a negative star rating too. This is the first time I ordered the AC for my room. Was pretty excited before I got the clear picture. In the description it has been mentioned that they would be providing a Copper tube grove but the compressor which came has an Aluminium tube! The description mentioned by Amazon is absolutely deceiving. For the service provided by Voltas all that i can say is... its Awful!...  The worst service ever! An engineer was supposed to contact me in 24 hours for installation but there was no response for 3 days!... Absolutely unsatisfied with  the product and service provided  by Amazon and Voltas both!,"This is one of the best buys Ive ever made!This a/c looks so sleek,is silent and cools very soon.It barely takes any time at all to cool the entire room+closed balcony!Definitely recommended to everyone,I love it!","I am fed up with Voltas guys as they are not coming for installing the product.

Till now satisfied with the product. 1 star less only due to delay in installation.,1 tons,39 dB,"If this product could be used out of the box, I would rate it 5 star. Unfortunately when you buy an AC you must also get the thing fitted before you can use it. That is where Voltas SUCKS! Nobody called us for 5 days after the delivery for installation. When we called them repeatedly and threatened to return the AC, they grudgingly came by for installation. The guys who came told my mother that they'd have to cut the windows in order to install it (mind you, this is a split AC)!! When I told them that that's not acceptable and we'd return the AC, they said go ahead and left happily :D. I was able to get external help to get it fitted correctly without any structural changes and the product itself works great.Buyer Beware: If you buy this product, add about Rs. 3,500 to your budget as installation cost.","I am amazed with quality of Ac, as it's equivalent with other 1.5 ton Ac.. Only for installation, you need to be pro active.. Bought on Lightning deal with credit card offer","After lots of search I bought this item.

I am a journalist and can tell the world how I have received a product that does not work, no customer service, and been insulted by my honest review being rejected for its content.

However, EasyHome's shipment needs improvement - 1 of the locks (used to hang on the wall metal frame) was broken on arrival - I have attached the broken lock and normal locks photos, pls see. Installation team was good enough to organize it in a couple of days ELSE I would have to deal with replacement process with Amazon/ EasyHome, which would have taken longer. Though unrelated but installation also substandard.","Superb AC! I'm glad to have bought this. My model is DYe which is an upgrade of this model. I got the DYe model when I ordered this DY model. So you may also receive what I got. It's quite powerful and cools our large bedroom instantly and efficiently. To my knowledge this is the most efficient 2 Ton AC in the market (at the time of writing). I couldn't find any 2 Ton AC consuming less than 1741 watts (1774 watts is for DY model). It has all the features a good AC should. There are advanced and sophisticated models from Hitachi. However with more sophistication comes the difficulty to service or repair the unit. There is still shortage of qualified technicians. Personally I would wait a few more years before adopting such advanced models in order to avoid the headaches of after sales service.My experience with the Voltas service was a good one. These guys installed the unit on the day I received it. I had some issues after the installation which was also resolved to my satisfaction. I still look forward to experiencing the professionalism shown in developed countries. The Indian service simply lack that. Anyway the service aspect was one of the main reasons to opt a Voltas product.You will have to buy a wall mount separately for the ODU. You will also need to buy a 15 Amp stabilizer to handle voltage fluctuations. Besides this the technician may ask you to get 500 g of white cement to seal the opening of the wall. An installation charge of Rs. 1,500 + Rs. 350 (Installing the Wall Mount) will also be charged. Well these are the additional costs you will incur along with this unit. These installation charges may vary depending on your location.In all this is an powerful AC capable of cooling large rooms including showrooms!",,AC was in good in condition and working fine.,,,B00LWRDWVO," 45,000.00",Voltas,"Voltas 245 DY Delux Y Series Split AC (2 Ton, 5 Star Rating, White, Copper): Amazon.in: Home & Kitchen",4 reviews,5 Star Rating,245 DY,"57,190.00",Remote Control,2.0 T 245 DY,#13,"#7,500",White,1774 Watts,Split,3.8 out of 5 stars,230 Volts,http://www.amazon.in/Voltas-245-DY-Rating-Copper/dp/B00LWRDWVO/ref=sr_1_11/253-2924686-6320101?ie=UTF8&qid=1485079627&s=kitchen&sr=1-11

I rechecked with the website where it is mentioned that the charges for installation can range between 300-1500 Rs. The technician after inspecting the AC quoted an amount of 3200 by saying all kinds of non sense "" extra "" things. More so , he used filthy language when we told him that the website has actually quoted the price range for the installation . I did not expect this kind of behaviour from a Voltas employee. We refused to get the installation done by this AC technician and have lodged a complaint with Voltas too. We requested a private AC installer who did the job for 1200 rs. The technician even threatened us that if we get the job done from any other company then we will loose the warranty.

Good product & 5star service from Amazon... But third class service from LG.,1 tons,35 dB,"I am reviewing the ac after 2 months of usage.  I am breaking down my review in parts :1.  deliverymy seller was cloudtail which is a trusted seller according to my experiences. However, they didn't provide 1 day or 2 day delivery option even though I stay in Delhi.  The delivery took 4 days.  their delivery staff helped me in carrying the ac components till the 4th floor. Great.2. Installation.  I called for an LG technician that day and the installation happened later in the evening. it took an hour.  charges 1900 which includes, outer mounting stand rs600, 2 metre extra wire for stabilizer as I mounted on top rs 160 and rest amount is installation charges. anyway, they were LG technicians and I got a reciept for the work.3. Cooling factor : considering my room size which is more than 10 x 11 ft, plus a kitchen and a corridor, the ac cools fast.

After spending on the installation & wasting 4 hrs of time, it turned out to be in Non-Working condition. As per the service engineer No output to AC is working, needs a part replacement. Moreover he isn't sure which part & by when it will be sent. Absolutely No Accountability & Ownership from LG representatives. It takes several calls to get to the Reps & online complaint system is worst (Can't log complain online).I would rather ask for a New Product Replacement or total REFUND. Such a disappointing experience with our first LG product. Looking forward for a quick reSolution asap.","Thanks Amazon for the good deal, I got the product at 24600 with promotion + 10% hdfc cash back. Also following up with lg for getting it installed. I bought the outdoor stand and v Guard separately ( 800+1800). Installation cost around 1750","Its an amazing product. Amazon did a fantastic job of following up with LG for installation, LG it self was pretty pathetic with it. I has to register for installation multiple times. Once you get the service guy at your home things get smoother. The installation guys were very professional, they did a good job. The AC is a true five star from electrical consumption point of view. With a average run of 12 hours per day the additional bill was around 800 Rs which is very economical. The night mode with auto temperature increment is a very useful feature. The controls are easy to use. I wish the remote had light in it, that would have made it easy to operate in the night, it not a big hindrance. The economy mode is very useful, and I use that all the time. Remember to always buy a voltage stabilizer with it. All in all a very good buy.","The AC is really awesome. Although the time taken to cool the room is little high, might be my room is little large. But I sleep right below the AC, so I get cool air immediately. Overall the AC is serving the purpose very well. I used an average of 10hrs a day for 15 days at 28 degrees. I got an increase of just 200rs in my power bill. That's really surprising!","Its good . So far.but cooling doesn't stay for long after turning it off..

Very good product for reasonable price. All Cooper condenser tubing guarantee longer life and comparable bigger outer unit ensure faster cooling in lesser time. Performance of AC also depends on installation. Prompt and genuine installation service provided. Installer were knowledgeable and responsible person. I thanks Electrolux company for providing this product. It gives peace of mind and satisfaction.,1.5 tons,45 dB,"Intense summer forced me to go in for the first time ever ac for 2 rooms.My brand perception and image of Electrolux, not the sales pitch and the very reasonable price for the 5 star rated ac made me buy it . It was delivered very promptly and installed it on the top floor of the building. Unaware of the intricacies of ac installation and lack of advice from the generic ac installer I let them install the usual way on the sunshade with brackets. The noise from the outdoor unit kept us awake most of the night with the compressor kicking in and out struggling with the extreme temperatures. This started an on going email issue with Electroluxs customer service for almost 2 months. My point being that it was the installer/ company's primary duty to customer to recommend that the top floor installation be on the inside parapet wall on the door side to quieten the noise. Finally good business sense expected from a company of electrolux caliber prevailed and they reinstalled the acs. An avoidable effort had this recommendation been proffered in the first instance. My suggestion to Drill an additional hole to reroute the conduit to avoid unsightly over the wall placement as done now was over ruled by the latest installer under the excuse that the efficiency would be affected by too many bends of the conduit. The same one extra bend now used to relocate. May be he was not keen to go through the extra effort of drilling a 4 inch hole?I want to share my experience so companies and other customers install acs on the top most floor of the buildings on the roof side. THis in my case did bring down the noise level in the rooms by a whole 10 decibels to a whisper quiet level. Thanks to Electroluxs decision to give primacy to customer satisfaction over a few rupees and thus build loyalty.","I have total more than 20 ACs in my 2 home and clinic.I have came across almost all brands.Among them Electrolux , I find very reasonably priced and perfect.Though I have 7 Daikin AC , but never buy it, very pathetic after sale service.Carrier is also good brand and also good after sales.","Its a good buy and a 5 star rating at a cheaper rate. Something I liked very much is and helpful to all reading this review ; the copper pipes to the indoor unit enters it from back so U dont need to make any special arrangements to hide it unlike an LG split ac in my residence in which the copper pipes enter the machine from side and it looks shabby. The performance is good and the magic I liked it, the ac runs and u can switch off the display. so that the room remains dark. Standard installation charges are around 1700 rupees which are fair enough.","Good cooling. Looks nice and elegant. Fast shipping by seller.Installation done within 24 hours by Electrolux. Was unhappy with the additional installation charges which were Rs.1500+taxes+Rs.750 for outside wall brackets. All in all around Rs.2500.Would have prefered to pay 'Cash on delivery', but the option was not available.","Have bought it from somewhere else, but have to say that this is the best ac one can get under 30k.U get get everything u need like1.5 ton cooling.Copper condenser(personally checked)Bigger outdoor unit5 star rating(only Electrolux provides it in this price)Little bit noisy but i think one can adjust thatAlso in my case the installation guy came the next day after the arrival.","I purchased from a local dealer,cooling is very effective,,nice product,,,,,,,cheap and best in india,,,,,",Electrolux Service is not Good...No one is coming for installation...

Easy to operate4. Reasonably pricedCons:1. Has aluminium condenser (and not copper), but the cooling is amazing so that is sorted. Secondly voltas uses some blue technology to avoid rusting so the major two drawbacks of aluminium condenser are taken care off2.

The remote has almost everything that you need in today's ac.5. The outdoor unit is silent.Cons-1.First please check the seal of the package. Package was somehow tried to open but every other things were in place.2. Installation is Rs 2250/- . 1500 for just making a hole in the wall, drilling screws and mounting the inner unit.

"Wrong installation, have left drainage pipe open in my room. Already, costed Rs.5800/- for the installation and who knows how much else we have to spent. Made room so dirt, didn't even bother to clean anything. I have photos as proof proof for all this. But, Amazon delivery has no problems. Worst kind of service from Voltas. If you make such good products but if your service is ridiculous, your product is only going to cause inconvenience and suffering to customers.",1.5 tons,44 dB,"i wish i paid more heed to the negative reviews already there for this product. But the lightning sale was just too tempting, and i figured 'how bad can it really be?"" Bad decision. It's been pure and simple horrible! Its been 15 days since the purchase and i have not been able to use the AC even once. The first guy who came for the installation apparently left too much gas, causing ice formation in the indoor unit, which hence had to be kept switched off. 3 days later, someone came to resolve it, removed gas, and in the process not only made the AC completely non effective, but also broke the swing making it impossible for the flap to close. the call center rep assured me that he would get it checked on priority - but actually didn't note the problem at all! i just called up to ask the status of my complaint and have been pushed back a further 3 working days for resolution. Considering i've spent almost 40k of my hard earned cash on this piece of junk, i now wish i had gone with a tried and trusted brand instead. There is no escalation matrix, call center doesn't have a TL available for a chat, there are no mail ids to call, service center doesn't entertain calls - all you are left with is an ineffective call center rep, a text box to vent your frustrations online, and a broken AC. Hope you are stronger willed than I was - there are no free / discounted lunches, and if something is being sold at a heavy discount, it is quite likely that there is some problem with it.",Please do not buy... Amazon is misguiding customers by writing incorrect product description.Installation is not included. Voltas charges Rs 1500 for a very inefficient and untidy installation.Amazon mentions the product comes with a copper tube/compressor but the product comes with all aluminium which is a huge cost factor. Copper tube/compressors are always more durable and expensive than aluminium ones.,Wish there was a negative star rating too. This is the first time I ordered the AC for my room. Was pretty excited before I got the clear picture. In the description it has been mentioned that they would be providing a Copper tube grove but the compressor which came has an Aluminium tube! The description mentioned by Amazon is absolutely deceiving. For the service provided by Voltas all that i can say is... its Awful!...  The worst service ever! An engineer was supposed to contact me in 24 hours for installation but there was no response for 3 days!... Absolutely unsatisfied with  the product and service provided  by Amazon and Voltas both!,"This is one of the best buys Ive ever made!This a/c looks so sleek,is silent and cools very soon.It barely takes any time at all to cool the entire room+closed balcony!Definitely recommended to everyone,I love it!","I am fed up with Voltas guys as they are not coming for installing the product.

Installation. The call centre people label installation guys as engineers but trust me they r in no way comparable to actual engineer. In my case Midea and carrier does not provide installation themselves(in Delhi) but rather they rely on jeevans( same practise as flikart adopts). These guys did not even know how to break small hole in window glass(they were very young). They cracked my whole glass. They possessed tool but were not experienced to use them.Overall it's a nice product better than other Indian brands and their pathethic service","very good ac. this is our second unit after using the 1st one for over a year, as per the info we have, Midea supplies 90% mfg with parts and have launched their own products with partnerships with Carrier in India,service and support is from Carrier, which is very good. chills quickly / silent/good design / minimal features which result in simpler operations. would recommend this.","Amazon delivered the product (BANGALORE) after 10 days from actual order date.Purchase Date: 17-Apr-2016Deliver Date: 28-Apr-2016Installation: I was literally shuttling between Amazon - Midea - Account Manager - Branch Manager - Call Coordinator - Technician - Supervisor.All of them are Big time liar, they will not tell you what is your queue/wait time for installation instead giving all false statement.And finally after lots of followup between above team, finally instllation was done on 12-May-2016.Carrier/Midea do not have their own support base in Bangalore instead they depend on Aurora Cooling Solutions who does the installation for many different AC company.Finally AC looks great, performance is also good, but it is too early to evaluate and giving any proper review as this is a new product in the market from Carrier/Midea.",,I raised a request with Midea customer support on 13- Aug for installation.

worst product.outdoor unit is giving huge noise after running for an hour or so. the problem begins just after technician had installed on very first day.  I have raised a request to  voltas for technician arrival and no one has arrived yet. a complete rip off. i cant afford to lose my hard earned money.,1.5 tons,45 dB,"This AC has a Aluminium Compressor.I myself cofirmed this with Voltas.Don't go for it, better to go with a Copper Condenser AC.Would request Amazon to clearly state the Compressor Type for ALL Acs in the description.",It is a damaged piece and I dint expect this from amazon. I am attaching the photos also.,"It has Aluminium Compressor but don't worry if you are not living near coastal areas. Copper Compressor is build for coastal areas. Nothing happens to Aluminium Compressor. Such a good product in this price. This product consumes 1 Unit/Hour. You can calculate as per your need. Ac takes 3-4 min to cool the room when room temperature is 35.  It has LED display but it can be switched off so don't worry. To be honest , it has smooth swinging. I don't find any noisy voice. Go for it.BUT BUT BUTVoltas service is such a Ridiculous and Pathetic. Voltas technician are not at all expert in installation. Better is go for local technicians whom you know. They never listen and given genuine answer. This is big disappointment from Voltas.","Nice aesthetics, good performance. But installation from Voltas is not that great. It is expensive and not satisfactory. I had researched a lot of ACs including LG and other brands, but finally settled for Voltas because of good pricing and not significant disadvantages over other ACs.","I did a lot of research to find out the difference between 185CY and 185JY but there was hardly anything available on the net. Now that I have both the models installed at my home, let me try to summarize the difference:1) Sleep mode - In 185CY, all the lights can be switched off so it not disturb your sleep but in 185JY, you will have 1 light 'on' even in sleep mode. Worst part is  - this light starts flickering as soon as the outdoor unit shuts off. If you are sleeping in a dark room without any night lamp, this may annoy your sleep2) Looks - Aesthetically, 185JY beats 185CY hands down. It looks premium and the display is also very nice3) Features - One important feature that 185JY misses over 185CY is 'auto' fan speed. This is a very good feature in CY which increases the fan speed and helps cool faster automatically rather than you controlling the fan speed in the middle of the night. All other features seems to be same4) Sound level - I felt 185CY to be quieter than JY5) Remote - CY remote looks better than JY but this is debatableOverall, a good product from Voltas other than the flickering light!!","Quite Satisfied with this all rounder.It's been 4 months of use now and I think the AC is working perfect for my mid size room. The installation done by Voltas was quick but bit messy partly due to layout of the Room. The ODU (outdoor unit) is huge but the body of both IDU (indoor unit) and ODU feels nice and sturdy and both units are silent.IDU in particular has nice features and feels elegant.I am happy and impressed with this Voltas AC, and I might update this review again after 1 year just to confirm if its performance remains same or has deteriorated.",prize difference is too mch as compared to snapdealso pls fix the problem,B00VT3CLRM," 33,490.00",Voltas,"Voltas 185JY Split AC (1.5 Ton, 5 Star Rating, White, Copper): Amazon.in: Home & Kitchen",39 reviews,5 Star Rating,185JY,"46,290.00",Remote Control,185JY,#3,"#1,354",White,1430 Watts,Split,4.0 out of 5 stars,230 Volts,http://www.amazon.in/Voltas-185JY-Split-Rating-Copper/dp/B00VT3CLRM/ref=sr_1_2/253-2924686-6320101?ie=UTF8&qid=1485079627&s=kitchen&sr=1-2

You need to pay @250 for Copper pipe (minimum of 10 ft.), @45 for electrical wire, @30 for water pipe. Always ask the installer what would be the total cost of installation.

Compressor switches on pretty soon to experience cool air almost instantly(within less than a minute).+ I have 3 hitachi A/Cs at home and they have been running without any issues ( I haven't even put AMC trusting on the ACs ).- Expect to spend atleast around 6,000-8,000 INR more after you purchase this A/C for getting the stabilizer and the installations.* I ordered the AC at Amazon for ~43,000 INR ( I got 5,000 INR as gift card, so, eventually, I am paying only 38,000 INR ). Awesome ordering experience from Amazon.* Note that the AC doesn't come with stabilizer. So, I need to spend ~3.6k for the stabilizer ( bought it from an offline store ).* The installation is not free of cost. The cost of installation varies primarily with the distance of the 'outdoor unit' from the place where you fit the A/C inside the room. Overall, I spent close to 4,000 INR for the installation ( including the materials ).Summary, I spent 43K-5K+3.6K+4K = 45.6K for getting the AC completely installed at my home. I still believe this is a good deal from Amazon, but I hadn't gone out to dealers to verify.One more thing. The Seller was Viveks.

,1.5 tons,,"I dont say that Amazon or any seller on these portals are genuine enough to sell you the right one but this is the only AC i would blindly go for. Proud owner of this model from last 3 years and not even a single time i felt going back to brands Hitachi (which has worst after sales service) and Voltas(worst cooling even from 2nd year).Got 8-10 ACs changed at my home with this model of O General.Just mind three things while looking for AC - manufacturing year, cooling capacity and good stabilizer.As Gas gets down in compressor every year if ACs are kept idle (not used) for long so keep them running, get them serviced regularly before season and use them as much.Advice:- Look for cooling capacity and not for Stars. This is just a market strategy where AC works like charm for 1-2 years at 5 star electricity saving but gets down to 1 star and that too with very low cooling and that's logical (since they've been made to save electricity).After 2 year you would feel that you wasted money and then companies would ask you to get it changed.One thing more, don't get into round robin state of getting gas refilled since it may work for 1 season or at max 2(that i really doubt) but chances of compressors getting damage increases a lot.Also always go for main stream  ton as you will find lot many options in it and always get 0.5 ton higher if your room is a bit big.Feel free to ask queries but i would be able to answer queries on weekends only...",,,,,,,B00KYT0RYG," 33,090.00",O General,"O General AXGT18AATH-1.5 Window AC (1.5 Ton, 2 Star Rating, White, Aluminium): Amazon.in: Home & Kitchen",16 reviews,2 Star Rating,AXGT18AATH,,Remote Control,AXGT18AATH,#162,"#1,75,146",White,1800 Watts,Window,4.3 out of 5 stars,240 Volts,http://www.amazon.in/General-AXGT18AATH-1-5-Window-Rating-Aluminium/dp/B00KYT0RYG/ref=sr_1_156/254-1923933-2335556?ie=UTF8&qid=1485079627&s=kitchen&sr=1-156

Installation charges should be minimal and ought to be controlled.,Pros:- Amazingly fast and strong cooling.- Its Noiseless.Cons:- Doesnt have manual option to set (move up and down) the air flow wings.- Installation team does not coordinate well and tell the requirements for installation.,"Instalation is too costly...i had to spend 4K for instalation only. Voltas should increase the length of copper wire and electric wire connecting odu n idu to at least 5 meter, or should provide at market rate, instalation guys charged too much for everything. AC is good, service from voltas is quick.","Delayed and vert Bad and messy installation by Voltas, product looks refurbished","This product assembled with Aluminium condenser instead of copper. So, I have discussed with voltas service people and local AC mechanic about this product and their replay makes me unhappy. Because the life aluminium condenser is 3 years maximum and will generate small holes due to faster oxidation than copper and also it cannot be repairable.Replacement cost is Rs.10000, It is not acceptable from the grate AC manufacturer.So please mention the demerits of this product in your specification.","DO NOT BUY ANY VOLTAS AC - POOR AFTER SALE SERVICE BY VOLTASVERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE BY VOLTAS TEAMIF YOU FACE ANY PROBLEM, CUSTOMER CARE WILL NOT HELP YOU & YOU HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME FOR THEIR TECHNICIAN TO VISIT.BETTER GO FOR OTHER BRAND AC'S.",Don't purchase split ac of voltas worst ac I have purchased instead go for Hitachi or Samsung they are long lasting and cooling is superb and noiseless.

"Please be careful if you are looking for a Hitachi A/C. It is not just their service that has quality issues but their products also are not reliable. Think twice before spending on Hitachi. I bought this model a/c 4 years ago and it is having only issues. All the frills stopped working in few months like dust sensors, swing,etc. And the the cooling started detonating. It is not able to cool 100sft room.The current problem is fins freezes and forms ice as in the picture and the A/C start blowing hot air.

Although the hitachi support people replaced the broken flap and re-connected the electrical part later after reporting to them repeatedly, we are yet to hear from their side on demo and resolution of the damaged fins. After few days of operation, the sound of the motor inside AC has increased which defeats the company's self proclaimed statement that it operates very SILENTLY.Request the MD,CEO,CIO,GMs, stake-holders of hitachi to take note ' and provide prompt resolution.2. The fins on the backside of ac were damaged in many places & informed to hitachi official but they ignored the complaint.","So far looking good to me. Cooling is nice, Noise level is considerably good comparing to my previous Carrier A/c. Let me check on the power consumption and update my review after few months.  Service request and follow-up were somewhat ok, but not like other market players (Samsung, LG).","Piece of junk metal. I'll never buy any Hitachi product again.I bought this product because I wanted a quiet AC and this had the lowest noise level specifications. Big mistake. It would put a cheap farm tractor to shame. I believe this is a design flaw as I saw a lot of reviews complaining about the same but the old reviews seem to have disappeared from all ecommerce sites now. It also sometimes makes a different gasping sound as if it is about to die of a sudden stroke or fall out of the window.Most important, it doesn't seem to be capable of handling Indian summers. My other airconditioners of other brands are far more efficient and are cheaper and more reliable.Hitachi service is as pathetic as the products are. The call centre is nearly impossible to contact. Either the number is busy and I once managed to reach the IVR, it did not accept any key presses. I had to finally get the number of my local service centre from someone. Another nightmare experience.It's been 12 days since my AC broke down. 3 days since it was finally picked up. It's past working hours and the service centre disconnected my call at 5:45 pm.

,1 tons,,Great for product from Hitachi for a 180 sq ft room with a window. Quiet running and cools fantastic.The 5 star rating is an added bonus. And you won't get it anywhere else at the price that amazon offers!.. believe me.. I did a lot of research :).,Absolutely perfect product for a 120 Sq ft room. Cool fast. Amazon Rocks with their service and the price in which it was delivered.. Have been using since only 2 days but until now all good . Product was very well packed and delivered on time. Hitachi Installation was absolute bang on. Overall everything was just perfect and as i wanted. No complaints.,"Excellent experience with delivery and installation. Only sad part was that two days after I bought it for INR 33600.. The price dropped to 31600. Anyway, since I'm optimistic and in India sometimes even paying extra the service and products might betray here goes - The AC is beautiful and looks much better than it appears on the photo. The noise is unbelievably low. I was more concerned about the sound levels of the outdoor unit as I did not want to disturb my neighbours and this AC has delivered!!! Needless to say the indoor unit is super silent as well. Installation guys came in less than 24 hours and were so pleasant. The whole experience was a breeze. Well done Amazon and Hitachi!",I think there is a need of sale for Hitachi products we are not getting quite good discount on AC please consider it. I mean not to compare store and websites. But to give what customer really wantThe discounts may only cover the price of installation so need to increase it.,I faced a lot of problem with AC Installation. I called Hitachi helpline number multiple time but they didn't picked up the call at all. I have to write lot of mails to amazon and Hitachi to get the work done.  Installation team was very rude and unprofessional and misguided us to have a drill on concrete and charges extra amount of money. Water outlet pipe was not given with the box (most others companies give the pipe) Instillation team forced us to purchase 12 feet pipe at 40 rupees (40*12=480 rupees) per feet cost (While market rate is just 100 rupees only). In short they are making a unprofessional business out of installation. Noise of the outdoor unit is very high (If you are living in an apartment then there may not be a severe problem but for individual houses it may be irritating.),,Indoor unit is very noisy not expected from split ac.

I am not sure if there are any other differences from the one listed here on Amazon India.Regarding the performance of the AC, I must say I am more than happy to have decided to go for a Panasonic AC. I am sorry to hear about the negative reviews from other buyers, but the unit I got from Reliance is top notch and there is hardly any sound audible. The cooling is extremely good and I was shivering even when the remote was set at 26 degrees.The outdoor unit was a little larger than the ones from other brands. This one bore a shiny metallic finish which made it stand apart from other outdoor units (mostly white) in my apartment.The only drawback is that I had to purchase extra electric wiring (~ 1 metre), water drain pipe (~ 2 metres) and a 16A 3 Pin -Top for the Stabilizer during the installation process. The installation was done 4 days after the date of purchase. BTW, Reliance offered Free standard installation and Voltage Stabilizer along with the purchase of an AC. :-)Panasonic India is providing 3 free services in the first year. This will include, among other things, gas refill if needed.Overall, I am happy with the purchase.

Good cooling for first month. Then as usual. Taking time to cool a room of 125 sqft. Else no complaints,1.5 tons,40 dB,"This is not a product review but review of Hyundai brand Service.The specifications of any of the Hyundai ACs do not say if the condenser is of copper or if the product is 100% copper as clearly mentioned by many other popular brands. I called Amazon customer care to find out and they didn't know either. So they gave me Bangalore customer care number (08039404040). I called Bangalore customer care and they gave me 2 more numbers to call (08041311700 and 9538887766) to figure out the details. I called both numbers repeatedly for an entire day and finally managed to get a reception from one number (9538887766). The lady who picked up asked me how i got her number. After i told her that i got it from Hyundai customer care and the reason for my call she gave me another number (7090268888) to call and find out the condenser and connecting pipe material details. The number she gave was giving out this message ""permanently barred all incoming calls"". So i called her back to tell her that the number wasn't helpful but as expected no response for the rest of the day. I even texted her that the number was no good.Now imagine their quality of customer service even before i buy the product. None of the people involved in the sales (Amazon) or service know what the product is made of and they want customers to buy their products.",I had brought the AC in May and so far I'm pretty happy with the performance.,"Hai buyers.

It was only after spending hours calling for support and being tossed around to different executives did I get the mandatory dry service after abt 20 days.3. The products are sub standard. The remote control for AC stopped working within 6 months with very minimal use. It was not dropped or had any external damage. It just stopped working on its own and I had to buy a new one.4. The call centre support is horrible. When the remote went bad i tried calling the toll free number. For 1 hr 02 seconds i was holding the call just listening to the tape ""Your Call is important to us. Our Executive will attend you shortly.""!!5. Their sales team is a pain in the neck!

But the lightning sale was just too tempting, and i figured 'how bad can it really be?"" Bad decision. It's been pure and simple horrible! Its been 15 days since the purchase and i have not been able to use the AC even once. The first guy who came for the installation apparently left too much gas, causing ice formation in the indoor unit, which hence had to be kept switched off. 3 days later, someone came to resolve it, removed gas, and in the process not only made the AC completely non effective, but also broke the swing making it impossible for the flap to close. the call center rep assured me that he would get it checked on priority - but actually didn't note the problem at all! i just called up to ask the status of my complaint and have been pushed back a further 3 working days for resolution. Considering i've spent almost 40k of my hard earned cash on this piece of junk, i now wish i had gone with a tried and trusted brand instead. There is no escalation matrix, call center doesn't have a TL available for a chat, there are no mail ids to call, service center doesn't entertain calls - all you are left with is an ineffective call center rep, a text box to vent your frustrations online, and a broken AC.

Amazon is misguiding customers by writing incorrect product description.Installation is not included. Voltas charges Rs 1500 for a very inefficient and untidy installation.Amazon mentions the product comes with a copper tube/compressor but the product comes with all aluminium which is a huge cost factor. Copper tube/compressors are always more durable and expensive than aluminium ones.,Wish there was a negative star rating too. This is the first time I ordered the AC for my room. Was pretty excited before I got the clear picture. In the description it has been mentioned that they would be providing a Copper tube grove but the compressor which came has an Aluminium tube! The description mentioned by Amazon is absolutely deceiving. For the service provided by Voltas all that i can say is... its Awful!...  The worst service ever! An engineer was supposed to contact me in 24 hours for installation but there was no response for 3 days!...

This is the 4th Hitachi AC for me, and once aGain i'm happy to report that this 5 star self cleaning all white split unit is a gem of a machine. Time will tell if this piece gives me as much peace of mind as my other ones.. Hitachi customer service has gotten better over the years as well. Cloudtail is the best seller for such items, & as usual i had a flawless experience. Installation is done by the compnay guys, within 2 days of you calling them.I suggest you call them 2 days before the scheduled delivery date so that the delivery and isntallation can happen in one day itself. If AC installation is not a new thing to you, & if your wall does not have an ac pipe outlet from before, then I would also suggest getting your local guy to make a hole in the wall about 3-4 sq inches  to allow for the drain pipes, the coolant pipes and the connection wire to pass thru between the indoor and outdoor unit. Also think about the electric connection for the ac, how far it is from the AC, the need for a stabilizer &/or an isolation ELCB, etc.In short, the more you're prepared, the better and easier it will be , with fewer surprises.Of course, if you've got people to take care of these things, then you probably wont read this bit anyway.

The AC was delivered on exactly the date and the time-slot I chose, which was pretty awesome.Re: Installation, apparently, the third-party Hitachi affiliated service folks are nearby my area itself, so it took them not more than 24 hours to send the technician for the installation. Took a while,4 hours or something to get everything up and running. It's been working flawlessly.NOTE : Installation for the AC was free for me, but doesn't apply to all the areas.P.S. NOTE: I brought the AC stand and Stabilizer from Hitachi itself, they have a tie up with a company in India called ""Ryoku"" or something. Quality stuff, but a bit pricey.Overall, I am loving it!

"The product is received in damaged condition. Its filter cover lock is broken it was taped and i just came to know when the tape on the cover came out. Such is the kind of product sold. Installation for window AC is also not free and installation charges are also high, when i got it installed from my ac technician amazon says that manufacturer will not give warranty for this product as it is not installed by Voltas.Dont buy its a advise, or buy at your own risk",1.5 tons,54 dB,"There is a manufacturing design fault with this model. I have this AC. The problem is that its metal capillaries are not adequately covered with padding and are exposed. Do to this design flaw, when the compressor switches on, the metal capillaries in a high vibrational state hit against each other creating a very disturbing sound in the middle of the night. This hitting is sporadic and does not manifest everytime the compressor switches on. It is sad that Voltas failed to adequately cover the inner capillaries. The solution is to call the neighbourhood AC repair guy and ask him to cover all the metal capillaries with foam padding and tape it properly. Secure the capillaries so that even when they vibrate at higher amplitudes and hit against each other the metal is covered and the sound is muffled. Once the AC repair guy covered the mettal capillaries with padding the capillary vibration sound decibels fell to inaudible levels. I bought this model in 2015 but not from Amazon. I wish I had bought over Amazon and returned this model back to Voltas.",Super cool ac. Thanks to amazon for the price n fast delivery!!!!,"In 1.5 months, a;ready repaired twice under warranty.

,1.2 tons,31 dB,"Hitachi AC's are in general one of the better ones out there. This is the 4th Hitachi AC for me, and once aGain i'm happy to report that this 5 star self cleaning all white split unit is a gem of a machine. Time will tell if this piece gives me as much peace of mind as my other ones.. Hitachi customer service has gotten better over the years as well. Cloudtail is the best seller for such items, & as usual i had a flawless experience. Installation is done by the compnay guys, within 2 days of you calling them.I suggest you call them 2 days before the scheduled delivery date so that the delivery and isntallation can happen in one day itself. If AC installation is not a new thing to you, & if your wall does not have an ac pipe outlet from before, then I would also suggest getting your local guy to make a hole in the wall about 3-4 sq inches  to allow for the drain pipes, the coolant pipes and the connection wire to pass thru between the indoor and outdoor unit. Also think about the electric connection for the ac, how far it is from the AC, the need for a stabilizer &/or an isolation ELCB, etc.In short, the more you're prepared, the better and easier it will be , with fewer surprises.Of course, if you've got people to take care of these things, then you probably wont read this bit anyway. Its a good model, go for it.One minor gripe, the remote for this does not come with a wall cradle.. :/ those were quite handy!",Excellent product. Best cooling effect. iClean is a wonderful feature. Go for it you will never regret. Amazon has given the best price. Retail shops are not even imagine that price.,"I have been searching and searching for a quality 1.2 Ton, 5 Energy Star rated AC and couldn't find anything below 35k.Luckily, Hitachi's RAU514IVD appeared on Amazon out of nowhere at a very tempting price and I had to take a leap of faith. The AC was delivered on exactly the date and the time-slot I chose, which was pretty awesome.Re: Installation, apparently, the third-party Hitachi affiliated service folks are nearby my area itself, so it took them not more than 24 hours to send the technician for the installation. Took a while,4 hours or something to get everything up and running. It's been working flawlessly.NOTE : Installation for the AC was free for me, but doesn't apply to all the areas.P.S. NOTE: I brought the AC stand and Stabilizer from Hitachi itself, they have a tie up with a company in India called ""Ryoku"" or something. Quality stuff, but a bit pricey.Overall, I am loving it!

This product does not come with electrical wire to connect the indoor and outdoor units. Better to buy this is advance as LG engineers overcharge for everything.4. This product does not come with extra drain pipe. Better to buy this is advance as LG engineers overcharge for everything.5.

I have this AC. The problem is that its metal capillaries are not adequately covered with padding and are exposed. Do to this design flaw, when the compressor switches on, the metal capillaries in a high vibrational state hit against each other creating a very disturbing sound in the middle of the night. This hitting is sporadic and does not manifest everytime the compressor switches on. It is sad that Voltas failed to adequately cover the inner capillaries. The solution is to call the neighbourhood AC repair guy and ask him to cover all the metal capillaries with foam padding and tape it properly. Secure the capillaries so that even when they vibrate at higher amplitudes and hit against each other the metal is covered and the sound is muffled. Once the AC repair guy covered the mettal capillaries with padding the capillary vibration sound decibels fell to inaudible levels. I bought this model in 2015 but not from Amazon.

Good product. As described in the specifications.Inner unit's noise is negligible but outer unit produces noise.,1 tons,40 dB,"Really happy with the AC and quick installation by voltas.Its 1 month now and I can say that it is a good machine, less frills, both IDU and ODU are silent and cooling is perfect.The room size is 100 sq.ft. in Mumbai and it was installed in May 2016 - peak summer.I can't comment yet on Electric consumption, that is to be seen when electricity bill arrives from BEST.-----------Update:  It's been 4 months of use now and I think the AC is working perfect for my small room. The installation was quick and clean by Voltas just after few days of purchase from Amazon. Though it may be because I stay in Mumbai where service is usually good.Initially I was bit worried about AC's 3 star rating, but as it turns out, electricity bill was less than expected and it is quite acceptable when I compare it with my other room's 5 Star rated Voltas AC(which is 1.5 ton).There is no display on the remote but it doesn't feel cheap. The body of IDU and ODU feels nice and sturdy and both units are surprisingly silent.So far I am impressed with this Voltas AC, and I might update this review again after 1 year just to confirm if its performance remains same or has deteriorated.","pathetic AC I have purchased 2 and its not cooling at all even after 2 to 3 hrs of operation raised a complaint with voltas they came and this is what heyhave to say...""THEY ALSO WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF IT WAS A FIRST TIME CUSTOMER YOU WOULDNT KNOW ONLY COS I HAVE USED A BETTER PRODUCT I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

They keep on sending messages about appointment for installation. No one turns up. After about ten days they turned up and took 7 hours to install. In order to shift a tube light, the installation guy demanded money. Finally they installed in a way that I could not open my window. In complaining voltas promptly sent some one to repair and rectify.  However I was stressed by daily follow up with voltas. It seems they give priority to installing ac's bought from offline retailers for whom installation is free as well.Now for the AC, I got it an incredible lightning price! (123lyb) AC for the price I paid is OK. No evidence of excess sound as some people are complaining. By the way there is difference in specifications between 123 lyi and lyb ( lyibis better with gold fins etc) All in all happy with the value proposition provided by AC, very unhappy with the voltas customer service. 4/5 for AC. 0/5 for voltas service.  Overall 2/5. If you buy, register a request with voltas on the day you order.",There is a loud noise from the AC from the day after installation.

Its been 15 days since the purchase and i have not been able to use the AC even once. The first guy who came for the installation apparently left too much gas, causing ice formation in the indoor unit, which hence had to be kept switched off. 3 days later, someone came to resolve it, removed gas, and in the process not only made the AC completely non effective, but also broke the swing making it impossible for the flap to close. the call center rep assured me that he would get it checked on priority - but actually didn't note the problem at all! i just called up to ask the status of my complaint and have been pushed back a further 3 working days for resolution. Considering i've spent almost 40k of my hard earned cash on this piece of junk, i now wish i had gone with a tried and trusted brand instead. There is no escalation matrix, call center doesn't have a TL available for a chat, there are no mail ids to call, service center doesn't entertain calls - all you are left with is an ineffective call center rep, a text box to vent your frustrations online, and a broken AC.

I called for an LG technician that day and the installation happened later in the evening. it took an hour.  charges 1900 which includes, outer mounting stand rs600, 2 metre extra wire for stabilizer as I mounted on top rs 160 and rest amount is installation charges. anyway, they were LG technicians and I got a reciept for the work.3. Cooling factor : considering my room size which is more than 10 x 11 ft, plus a kitchen and a corridor, the ac cools fast.  I don't use the Himalaya cooling, but just set the thermoset to 27-26 c which efficiently cools.4. Bills. my usage maybe 4-6 hours on an average.  the ac gives me an extra bill of 600 rs (bses Delhi rate)  which I ld say, is quite negligible considering the peace of mind you get amidst the soaring temperatures.5.Maintenance. till now I regularly clean the air filter as per the user manual. and I can say all is good.6.stabilizer. I got it from snapdeal, v guard 400 voltage for 1583 rs. local market they were not willing to go below rs 2000.7. total cost ac 24400 + installation 1900 + stab 1583 = 27883","Looking good, working good & I love it.But ln side unit shows  only 3 star instead of 5...Please explain me why","LG Team,We received a defective LG LSA3NP5A L-Nova Plus Split AC (1 Ton, 5 Star Rating, White) product purchased thru Amazon. After spending on the installation & wasting 4 hrs of time, it turned out to be in Non-Working condition. As per the service engineer No output to AC is working, needs a part replacement. Moreover he isn't sure which part & by when it will be sent. Absolutely No Accountability & Ownership from LG representatives. It takes several calls to get to the Reps & online complaint system is worst (Can't log complain online).I would rather ask for a New Product Replacement or total REFUND. Such a disappointing experience with our first LG product. Looking forward for a quick reSolution asap.","Thanks Amazon for the good deal, I got the product at 24600 with promotion + 10% hdfc cash back. Also following up with lg for getting it installed. I bought the outdoor stand and v Guard separately ( 800+1800). Installation cost around 1750","Its an amazing product. Amazon did a fantastic job of following up with LG for installation, LG it self was pretty pathetic with it. I has to register for installation multiple times. Once you get the service guy at your home things get smoother. The installation guys were very professional, they did a good job. The AC is a true five star from electrical consumption point of view. With a average run of 12 hours per day the additional bill was around 800 Rs which is very economical. The night mode with auto temperature increment is a very useful feature. The controls are easy to use. I wish the remote had light in it, that would have made it easy to operate in the night, it not a big hindrance. The economy mode is very useful, and I use that all the time. Remember to always buy a voltage stabilizer with it. All in all a very good buy.","The AC is really awesome. Although the time taken to cool the room is little high, might be my room is little large. But I sleep right below the AC, so I get cool air immediately. Overall the AC is serving the purpose very well. I used an average of 10hrs a day for 15 days at 28 degrees. I got an increase of just 200rs in my power bill. That's really surprising!","Its good . So far.but cooling doesn't stay for long after turning it off..

,2 tons,50 dB,"This AC has been installed by professionals fro HOUSE JOY services. Unfortunately it does not work. To be very specific....the out door unit of this split AC keeps tripping every time the unit is switched on. Thus the compressor does not work and there is no cooling.I have called Voltas customer care several times and I have still not received a call from their technician.This is the second time I am writing this review. The first time it was not posted as apparently it had spiteful or untrue content.I have spent Rs. 50000 of my hard earned money for a product that is not working and my review is rejected for being spiteful. If this review is not posted I will post a review in the news papers. I am a journalist and can tell the world how I have received a product that does not work, no customer service, and been insulted by my honest review being rejected for its content. This means Amazon only posts good reviews and bad ones are hidden to trick customers into buying!!! I'm sure people would like to read my review on a public consumer Forum as Amazon refuses to publish it!!!","Product is fine and as described and the delivery was timely. However, EasyHome's shipment needs improvement - 1 of the locks (used to hang on the wall metal frame) was broken on arrival - I have attached the broken lock and normal locks photos, pls see. Installation team was good enough to organize it in a couple of days ELSE I would have to deal with replacement process with Amazon/ EasyHome, which would have taken longer. Though unrelated but installation also substandard.","Superb AC! I'm glad to have bought this. My model is DYe which is an upgrade of this model. I got the DYe model when I ordered this DY model. So you may also receive what I got. It's quite powerful and cools our large bedroom instantly and efficiently. To my knowledge this is the most efficient 2 Ton AC in the market (at the time of writing). I couldn't find any 2 Ton AC consuming less than 1741 watts (1774 watts is for DY model). It has all the features a good AC should. There are advanced and sophisticated models from Hitachi. However with more sophistication comes the difficulty to service or repair the unit. There is still shortage of qualified technicians. Personally I would wait a few more years before adopting such advanced models in order to avoid the headaches of after sales service.My experience with the Voltas service was a good one. These guys installed the unit on the day I received it. I had some issues after the installation which was also resolved to my satisfaction. I still look forward to experiencing the professionalism shown in developed countries. The Indian service simply lack that. Anyway the service aspect was one of the main reasons to opt a Voltas product.You will have to buy a wall mount separately for the ODU. You will also need to buy a 15 Amp stabilizer to handle voltage fluctuations. Besides this the technician may ask you to get 500 g of white cement to seal the opening of the wall. An installation charge of Rs. 1,500 + Rs. 350 (Installing the Wall Mount) will also be charged. Well these are the additional costs you will incur along with this unit. These installation charges may vary depending on your location.In all this is an powerful AC capable of cooling large rooms including showrooms!",,AC was in good in condition and working fine.,,,B00LWRDWVO," 45,000.00",Voltas,"Voltas 245 DY Delux Y Series Split AC (2 Ton, 5 Star Rating, White, Copper): Amazon.in: Home & Kitchen",4 reviews,5 Star Rating,245 DY,"57,190.00",Remote Control,2.0 T 245 DY,#16,"#8,488",White,1774 Watts,Split,3.8 out of 5 stars,230 Volts,http://www.amazon.in/Voltas-245-DY-Rating-Copper/dp/B00LWRDWVO/ref=sr_1_11/255-8936376-8594201?ie=UTF8&qid=1485081727&s=kitchen&sr=1-11

Unfortunately when you buy an AC you must also get the thing fitted before you can use it. That is where Voltas SUCKS! Nobody called us for 5 days after the delivery for installation. When we called them repeatedly and threatened to return the AC, they grudgingly came by for installation. The guys who came told my mother that they'd have to cut the windows in order to install it (mind you, this is a split AC)!! When I told them that that's not acceptable and we'd return the AC, they said go ahead and left happily :D. I was able to get external help to get it fitted correctly without any structural changes and the product itself works great.Buyer Beware: If you buy this product, add about Rs. 3,500 to your budget as installation cost.","I am amazed with quality of Ac, as it's equivalent with other 1.5 ton Ac..

I called Bangalore customer care and they gave me 2 more numbers to call (08041311700 and 9538887766) to figure out the details. I called both numbers repeatedly for an entire day and finally managed to get a reception from one number (9538887766). The lady who picked up asked me how i got her number. After i told her that i got it from Hyundai customer care and the reason for my call she gave me another number (7090268888) to call and find out the condenser and connecting pipe material details. The number she gave was giving out this message ""permanently barred all incoming calls"". So i called her back to tell her that the number wasn't helpful but as expected no response for the rest of the day.

Its been 15 days since the purchase and i have not been able to use the AC even once. The first guy who came for the installation apparently left too much gas, causing ice formation in the indoor unit, which hence had to be kept switched off. 3 days later, someone came to resolve it, removed gas, and in the process not only made the AC completely non effective, but also broke the swing making it impossible for the flap to close. the call center rep assured me that he would get it checked on priority - but actually didn't note the problem at all! i just called up to ask the status of my complaint and have been pushed back a further 3 working days for resolution. Considering i've spent almost 40k of my hard earned cash on this piece of junk, i now wish i had gone with a tried and trusted brand instead.

worst product.outdoor unit is giving huge noise after running for an hour or so. the problem begins just after technician had installed on very first day.  I have raised a request to  voltas for technician arrival and no one has arrived yet. a complete rip off. i cant afford to lose my hard earned money.,1.5 tons,45 dB,"This AC has a Aluminium Compressor.I myself cofirmed this with Voltas.Don't go for it, better to go with a Copper Condenser AC.Would request Amazon to clearly state the Compressor Type for ALL Acs in the description.",It is a damaged piece and I dint expect this from amazon. I am attaching the photos also.,"It has Aluminium Compressor but don't worry if you are not living near coastal areas. Copper Compressor is build for coastal areas. Nothing happens to Aluminium Compressor. Such a good product in this price. This product consumes 1 Unit/Hour. You can calculate as per your need. Ac takes 3-4 min to cool the room when room temperature is 35.  It has LED display but it can be switched off so don't worry. To be honest , it has smooth swinging. I don't find any noisy voice. Go for it.BUT BUT BUTVoltas service is such a Ridiculous and Pathetic. Voltas technician are not at all expert in installation. Better is go for local technicians whom you know. They never listen and given genuine answer. This is big disappointment from Voltas.","Nice aesthetics, good performance. But installation from Voltas is not that great. It is expensive and not satisfactory. I had researched a lot of ACs including LG and other brands, but finally settled for Voltas because of good pricing and not significant disadvantages over other ACs.","I did a lot of research to find out the difference between 185CY and 185JY but there was hardly anything available on the net. Now that I have both the models installed at my home, let me try to summarize the difference:1) Sleep mode - In 185CY, all the lights can be switched off so it not disturb your sleep but in 185JY, you will have 1 light 'on' even in sleep mode. Worst part is  - this light starts flickering as soon as the outdoor unit shuts off. If you are sleeping in a dark room without any night lamp, this may annoy your sleep2) Looks - Aesthetically, 185JY beats 185CY hands down. It looks premium and the display is also very nice3) Features - One important feature that 185JY misses over 185CY is 'auto' fan speed. This is a very good feature in CY which increases the fan speed and helps cool faster automatically rather than you controlling the fan speed in the middle of the night. All other features seems to be same4) Sound level - I felt 185CY to be quieter than JY5) Remote - CY remote looks better than JY but this is debatableOverall, a good product from Voltas other than the flickering light!!","Quite Satisfied with this all rounder.It's been 4 months of use now and I think the AC is working perfect for my mid size room. The installation done by Voltas was quick but bit messy partly due to layout of the Room. The ODU (outdoor unit) is huge but the body of both IDU (indoor unit) and ODU feels nice and sturdy and both units are silent.IDU in particular has nice features and feels elegant.I am happy and impressed with this Voltas AC, and I might update this review again after 1 year just to confirm if its performance remains same or has deteriorated.",prize difference is too mch as compared to snapdealso pls fix the problem,B00VT3CLRM," 33,490.00",Voltas,"Voltas 185JY Split AC (1.5 Ton, 5 Star Rating, White, Copper): Amazon.in: Home & Kitchen",39 reviews,5 Star Rating,185JY,"46,290.00",Remote Control,185JY,#3,"#1,354",White,1430 Watts,Split,4.0 out of 5 stars,230 Volts,http://www.amazon.in/Voltas-185JY-Split-Rating-Copper/dp/B00VT3CLRM/ref=sr_1_2/255-8936376-8594201?ie=UTF8&qid=1485081727&s=kitchen&sr=1-2

After complaining to voltas a technician came after 3 days and could not fix the brand new unit. He confirmed a manufacturing defect in the indoor unit. Complained to voltas again and requested them replace the defective piece. Despite repeated complaints to voltas, second technician visited on 27 May ( 32 days after installation) and again wrote manufacturing fault on indoor as well as outdoor unit also this time which was tested then. Have spoken to /requested voltas cc and their regional head in Delhi to please make a solution but till date this unit is a show piece in my living room.

,1.5 tons,,"Summary:+ Great cooling effect. Compressor switches on pretty soon to experience cool air almost instantly(within less than a minute).+ I have 3 hitachi A/Cs at home and they have been running without any issues ( I haven't even put AMC trusting on the ACs ).- Expect to spend atleast around 6,000-8,000 INR more after you purchase this A/C for getting the stabilizer and the installations.* I ordered the AC at Amazon for ~43,000 INR ( I got 5,000 INR as gift card, so, eventually, I am paying only 38,000 INR ). Awesome ordering experience from Amazon.* Note that the AC doesn't come with stabilizer. So, I need to spend ~3.6k for the stabilizer ( bought it from an offline store ).* The installation is not free of cost. The cost of installation varies primarily with the distance of the 'outdoor unit' from the place where you fit the A/C inside the room. Overall, I spent close to 4,000 INR for the installation ( including the materials ).Summary, I spent 43K-5K+3.6K+4K = 45.6K for getting the AC completely installed at my home. I still believe this is a good deal from Amazon, but I hadn't gone out to dealers to verify.One more thing. The Seller was Viveks. The seller was very very prompt, he called me to provide regular updates and even shipped the product the next day itself!I am reducing one star because of the following: Amazon.in website said that it couldn't ship the item to my home(600096). So, I tried to ship it to my relatives place(600092) where it allowed me to order the product. When Viveks called me, I told them my house address and they were actually able to ship it to my house itself.

,1.5 tons,,"I dont say that Amazon or any seller on these portals are genuine enough to sell you the right one but this is the only AC i would blindly go for. Proud owner of this model from last 3 years and not even a single time i felt going back to brands Hitachi (which has worst after sales service) and Voltas(worst cooling even from 2nd year).Got 8-10 ACs changed at my home with this model of O General.Just mind three things while looking for AC - manufacturing year, cooling capacity and good stabilizer.As Gas gets down in compressor every year if ACs are kept idle (not used) for long so keep them running, get them serviced regularly before season and use them as much.Advice:- Look for cooling capacity and not for Stars. This is just a market strategy where AC works like charm for 1-2 years at 5 star electricity saving but gets down to 1 star and that too with very low cooling and that's logical (since they've been made to save electricity).After 2 year you would feel that you wasted money and then companies would ask you to get it changed.One thing more, don't get into round robin state of getting gas refilled since it may work for 1 season or at max 2(that i really doubt) but chances of compressors getting damage increases a lot.Also always go for main stream  ton as you will find lot many options in it and always get 0.5 ton higher if your room is a bit big.Feel free to ask queries but i would be able to answer queries on weekends only...",,,,,,,B00KYT0RYG," 33,090.00",O General,"O General AXGT18AATH-1.5 Window AC (1.5 Ton, 2 Star Rating, White, Aluminium): Amazon.in: Home & Kitchen",16 reviews,2 Star Rating,AXGT18AATH,,Remote Control,AXGT18AATH,#162,"#1,75,146",White,1800 Watts,Window,4.3 out of 5 stars,240 Volts,http://www.amazon.in/General-AXGT18AATH-1-5-Window-Rating-Aluminium/dp/B00KYT0RYG/ref=sr_1_157/254-0416682-0473514?ie=UTF8&qid=1485081722&s=kitchen&sr=1-157

,1.5 tons,52 dB,I purchased this window airconditioner before few months and below is my honest review of the product.Pro's:1. 5 Star rating - so better energy saving2. Low noise level and  good airflow.3 . Very good cooling observed even in 37 degree Celsius4. Easy to clean the air filterCon's:1. Remote control should have been more friendly2. Difficult to use during night time as there is no radium kind of button in remote control.Considering the energy rating and quality of cooling i would rate this as 5/5.Real photos of the product is attached. Kindly vote if this review is helpful,Good product,"I didn't buy this AC from Amazon though, but its a great AC. I bought the same but, 3 star AC, a month ago.This is my first Carrier product.The cooling is really superb.The noise level is tolerable(not very loud).So for performance i'll give it 5 on 5.The only bad thing about it is the Remote. Its a bit old fashioned and has no screen on it. It doesn't even come with a wall mounting stand/holder.At night, you wouldn't see the buttons of the remote at all and its super small.But anyways, I would recommend buying this AC.",,"Though not purchased the product from Amazon, overall excellent product.

Very good product for reasonable price. All Cooper condenser tubing guarantee longer life and comparable bigger outer unit ensure faster cooling in lesser time. Performance of AC also depends on installation. Prompt and genuine installation service provided. Installer were knowledgeable and responsible person. I thanks Electrolux company for providing this product. It gives peace of mind and satisfaction.,1.5 tons,45 dB,"Intense summer forced me to go in for the first time ever ac for 2 rooms.My brand perception and image of Electrolux, not the sales pitch and the very reasonable price for the 5 star rated ac made me buy it . It was delivered very promptly and installed it on the top floor of the building. Unaware of the intricacies of ac installation and lack of advice from the generic ac installer I let them install the usual way on the sunshade with brackets. The noise from the outdoor unit kept us awake most of the night with the compressor kicking in and out struggling with the extreme temperatures. This started an on going email issue with Electroluxs customer service for almost 2 months. My point being that it was the installer/ company's primary duty to customer to recommend that the top floor installation be on the inside parapet wall on the door side to quieten the noise. Finally good business sense expected from a company of electrolux caliber prevailed and they reinstalled the acs. An avoidable effort had this recommendation been proffered in the first instance. My suggestion to Drill an additional hole to reroute the conduit to avoid unsightly over the wall placement as done now was over ruled by the latest installer under the excuse that the efficiency would be affected by too many bends of the conduit. The same one extra bend now used to relocate. May be he was not keen to go through the extra effort of drilling a 4 inch hole?I want to share my experience so companies and other customers install acs on the top most floor of the buildings on the roof side. THis in my case did bring down the noise level in the rooms by a whole 10 decibels to a whisper quiet level. Thanks to Electroluxs decision to give primacy to customer satisfaction over a few rupees and thus build loyalty.","I have total more than 20 ACs in my 2 home and clinic.I have came across almost all brands.Among them Electrolux , I find very reasonably priced and perfect.Though I have 7 Daikin AC , but never buy it, very pathetic after sale service.Carrier is also good brand and also good after sales.","Its a good buy and a 5 star rating at a cheaper rate. Something I liked very much is and helpful to all reading this review ; the copper pipes to the indoor unit enters it from back so U dont need to make any special arrangements to hide it unlike an LG split ac in my residence in which the copper pipes enter the machine from side and it looks shabby. The performance is good and the magic I liked it, the ac runs and u can switch off the display. so that the room remains dark. Standard installation charges are around 1700 rupees which are fair enough.","Good cooling. Looks nice and elegant. Fast shipping by seller.Installation done within 24 hours by Electrolux. Was unhappy with the additional installation charges which were Rs.1500+taxes+Rs.750 for outside wall brackets. All in all around Rs.2500.Would have prefered to pay 'Cash on delivery', but the option was not available.","Have bought it from somewhere else, but have to say that this is the best ac one can get under 30k.U get get everything u need like1.5 ton cooling.Copper condenser(personally checked)Bigger outdoor unit5 star rating(only Electrolux provides it in this price)Little bit noisy but i think one can adjust thatAlso in my case the installation guy came the next day after the arrival.","I purchased from a local dealer,cooling is very effective,,nice product,,,,,,,cheap and best in india,,,,,",Electrolux Service is not Good...No one is coming for installation...

"Please be careful if you are looking for a Hitachi A/C. It is not just their service that has quality issues but their products also are not reliable. Think twice before spending on Hitachi. I bought this model a/c 4 years ago and it is having only issues. All the frills stopped working in few months like dust sensors, swing,etc. And the the cooling started detonating. It is not able to cool 100sft room.The current problem is fins freezes and forms ice as in the picture and the A/C start blowing hot air. I have raised till now three tickets and they keep closing without addressing it.Thank you.

I logged a complaint in Hitachi service center however unprofessional technician visited my place but thay are not able to resolve the issue, I requested them to replace it but they don't even listen you and close the case. Guys this is pathetic ac and worst service provided by Hitachi, please don't buy it else you will buy headech.","1. Although the hitachi support people replaced the broken flap and re-connected the electrical part later after reporting to them repeatedly, we are yet to hear from their side on demo and resolution of the damaged fins. After few days of operation, the sound of the motor inside AC has increased which defeats the company's self proclaimed statement that it operates very SILENTLY.Request the MD,CEO,CIO,GMs, stake-holders of hitachi to take note ' and provide prompt resolution.2. The fins on the backside of ac were damaged in many places & informed to hitachi official but they ignored the complaint.","So far looking good to me. Cooling is nice, Noise level is considerably good comparing to my previous Carrier A/c. Let me check on the power consumption and update my review after few months.  Service request and follow-up were somewhat ok, but not like other market players (Samsung, LG).","Piece of junk metal. I'll never buy any Hitachi product again.I bought this product because I wanted a quiet AC and this had the lowest noise level specifications. Big mistake. It would put a cheap farm tractor to shame. I believe this is a design flaw as I saw a lot of reviews complaining about the same but the old reviews seem to have disappeared from all ecommerce sites now. It also sometimes makes a different gasping sound as if it is about to die of a sudden stroke or fall out of the window.Most important, it doesn't seem to be capable of handling Indian summers. My other airconditioners of other brands are far more efficient and are cheaper and more reliable.Hitachi service is as pathetic as the products are. The call centre is nearly impossible to contact. Either the number is busy and I once managed to reach the IVR, it did not accept any key presses. I had to finally get the number of my local service centre from someone. Another nightmare experience.It's been 12 days since my AC broke down. 3 days since it was finally picked up. It's past working hours and the service centre disconnected my call at 5:45 pm. Pathetic!!!","I am using 3 Hitachi ACs. All of them fail every summer since past five years. Frequently fan motor fails. The repair takes almost 20 to 30 days. No one bothers to answer calls.

I am not sure if there are any other differences from the one listed here on Amazon India.Regarding the performance of the AC, I must say I am more than happy to have decided to go for a Panasonic AC. I am sorry to hear about the negative reviews from other buyers, but the unit I got from Reliance is top notch and there is hardly any sound audible. The cooling is extremely good and I was shivering even when the remote was set at 26 degrees.The outdoor unit was a little larger than the ones from other brands. This one bore a shiny metallic finish which made it stand apart from other outdoor units (mostly white) in my apartment.The only drawback is that I had to purchase extra electric wiring (~ 1 metre), water drain pipe (~ 2 metres) and a 16A 3 Pin -Top for the Stabilizer during the installation process. The installation was done 4 days after the date of purchase. BTW, Reliance offered Free standard installation and Voltage Stabilizer along with the purchase of an AC. :-)Panasonic India is providing 3 free services in the first year. This will include, among other things, gas refill if needed.Overall, I am happy with the purchase.

"Please be careful if you are looking for a Hitachi A/C. It is not just their service that has quality issues but their products also are not reliable. Think twice before spending on Hitachi. I bought this model a/c 4 years ago and it is having only issues. All the frills stopped working in few months like dust sensors, swing,etc. And the the cooling started detonating. It is not able to cool 100sft room.The current problem is fins freezes and forms ice as in the picture and the A/C start blowing hot air. I have raised till now three tickets and they keep closing without addressing it.Thank you.

I logged a complaint in Hitachi service center however unprofessional technician visited my place but thay are not able to resolve the issue, I requested them to replace it but they don't even listen you and close the case. Guys this is pathetic ac and worst service provided by Hitachi, please don't buy it else you will buy headech.","1. Although the hitachi support people replaced the broken flap and re-connected the electrical part later after reporting to them repeatedly, we are yet to hear from their side on demo and resolution of the damaged fins. After few days of operation, the sound of the motor inside AC has increased which defeats the company's self proclaimed statement that it operates very SILENTLY.Request the MD,CEO,CIO,GMs, stake-holders of hitachi to take note ' and provide prompt resolution.2. The fins on the backside of ac were damaged in many places & informed to hitachi official but they ignored the complaint.","So far looking good to me. Cooling is nice, Noise level is considerably good comparing to my previous Carrier A/c. Let me check on the power consumption and update my review after few months.  Service request and follow-up were somewhat ok, but not like other market players (Samsung, LG).","Piece of junk metal. I'll never buy any Hitachi product again.I bought this product because I wanted a quiet AC and this had the lowest noise level specifications. Big mistake. It would put a cheap farm tractor to shame. I believe this is a design flaw as I saw a lot of reviews complaining about the same but the old reviews seem to have disappeared from all ecommerce sites now. It also sometimes makes a different gasping sound as if it is about to die of a sudden stroke or fall out of the window.Most important, it doesn't seem to be capable of handling Indian summers. My other airconditioners of other brands are far more efficient and are cheaper and more reliable.Hitachi service is as pathetic as the products are. The call centre is nearly impossible to contact. Either the number is busy and I once managed to reach the IVR, it did not accept any key presses. I had to finally get the number of my local service centre from someone. Another nightmare experience.It's been 12 days since my AC broke down. 3 days since it was finally picked up. It's past working hours and the service centre disconnected my call at 5:45 pm. Pathetic!!!","I am using 3 Hitachi ACs. All of them fail every summer since past five years. Frequently fan motor fails. The repair takes almost 20 to 30 days. No one bothers to answer calls.

Honestly speaking, the AC is 2 gud, very less power consumption and excellent cooling. It cools my 12'x12'  top floor room within 5-7 mins. Zero noise and very simple remote functions. Only demerit is, it doesn't have a dual temp display, I.e room and AC both.

Excellent model.The couple of drawbacks are the fan swing is not complete.. It just rotates around 10- 15 deg.. If you have fitted your AC behind your cot then the cool air will reach after 3 - 4ft only. I expect the swing to be compete.Another drawback is the noise.. I tried auto mode which is horrible.. The AC runs for sometime and then cuts off.. After few mins the compressor runs and blows the cool air at max fan speed.. This will disturb the sleep for sure.. Also if I keep the AC at fan speed 1 then also the noise level is high.. I brought the AC from reliance digital and  have complained too. The service person complains on the model. I called  Panasonic and they say as the model is brought from Reliance, they r not going to service. I donno what to do.",Nice cooling capacity. Cools my bed room in 2 to 3 minutes of time.

,1 tons,,"O General 1 ton AC with 3 Star is a excellent product. It coll my 120 sqft room very efficiently. Outdoor unit also doesn't make any noise.But keep in mind that O General doesn't provide any accessories like copper gas pipe, electrical wire & water pipe. You need to pay @250 for Copper pipe (minimum of 10 ft.), @45 for electrical wire, @30 for water pipe. Always ask the installer what would be the total cost of installation. In my case installation was free but I was charged of Rs. 5990 for the above mentioned accessories, how ever I installed the indoor & outdoor unit back to back my bedroom wall. So don't doubt about the product quality but be aware of the installation cost.Also I faced a lot of trouble with the installer. At first my outdoor unit was not working. The installer installed my AC without any proper equipment & asked me to change the entire wiring & I did the same. But then it was found that the outdoor unit is faulty. O General changed my unit within 7 days. Another installer came from O General & installed the unit with proper equipment & said that I should not change the previous wiring.SO PLEASE CHECK WHETHER YOUR INSTALLER HAS COME FROM O GENERAL OR HE IS A LOCAL AC MECHANIC.",,"I got it off a local dealer for 37k with installation inc copper piping, v-guard stabiliser, wiring and wall brackets.It cools my room (150 sft) in about 30 to 40 min. I thought about other brands but O General is O General.I like the looks plain and simple in white. Consumption is about a unit per hour - if put in auto mode it turns off when the desired temp is reached and turns back on when it goes up. You can set it to sleep or set the timer to turn it off and turn back on too.It is super quite in quite mode but not as chilly as it is at high speed which is a little buzzy but ok I guess.The only drawback is that the remote is not backlit.

Made room so dirt, didn't even bother to clean anything. I have photos as proof proof for all this. But, Amazon delivery has no problems. Worst kind of service from Voltas.

But the lightning sale was just too tempting, and i figured 'how bad can it really be?"" Bad decision. It's been pure and simple horrible! Its been 15 days since the purchase and i have not been able to use the AC even once. The first guy who came for the installation apparently left too much gas, causing ice formation in the indoor unit, which hence had to be kept switched off. 3 days later, someone came to resolve it, removed gas, and in the process not only made the AC completely non effective, but also broke the swing making it impossible for the flap to close. the call center rep assured me that he would get it checked on priority - but actually didn't note the problem at all! i just called up to ask the status of my complaint and have been pushed back a further 3 working days for resolution. Considering i've spent almost 40k of my hard earned cash on this piece of junk, i now wish i had gone with a tried and trusted brand instead. There is no escalation matrix, call center doesn't have a TL available for a chat, there are no mail ids to call, service center doesn't entertain calls - all you are left with is an ineffective call center rep, a text box to vent your frustrations online, and a broken AC. Hope you are stronger willed than I was - there are no free / discounted lunches, and if something is being sold at a heavy discount, it is quite likely that there is some problem with it.",Please do not buy... Amazon is misguiding customers by writing incorrect product description.Installation is not included. Voltas charges Rs 1500 for a very inefficient and untidy installation.Amazon mentions the product comes with a copper tube/compressor but the product comes with all aluminium which is a huge cost factor. Copper tube/compressors are always more durable and expensive than aluminium ones.,Wish there was a negative star rating too. This is the first time I ordered the AC for my room. Was pretty excited before I got the clear picture. In the description it has been mentioned that they would be providing a Copper tube grove but the compressor which came has an Aluminium tube! The description mentioned by Amazon is absolutely deceiving. For the service provided by Voltas all that i can say is... its Awful!...  The worst service ever! An engineer was supposed to contact me in 24 hours for installation but there was no response for 3 days!... Absolutely unsatisfied with  the product and service provided  by Amazon and Voltas both!,"This is one of the best buys Ive ever made!This a/c looks so sleek,is silent and cools very soon.It barely takes any time at all to cool the entire room+closed balcony!Definitely recommended to everyone,I love it!","I am fed up with Voltas guys as they are not coming for installing the product.

I am frustrated by the way Voltas people answer. The worst customer care and worst service.","After reading many reviews on various portals i was sceptical to buy online due to mainly installation issues, faulty product issues.My experience has been as followsAmazon - Phenominal service, great tracking, spot on delivery, good packaging and very friendly customer service.

This is the 4th Hitachi AC for me, and once aGain i'm happy to report that this 5 star self cleaning all white split unit is a gem of a machine. Time will tell if this piece gives me as much peace of mind as my other ones.. Hitachi customer service has gotten better over the years as well. Cloudtail is the best seller for such items, & as usual i had a flawless experience. Installation is done by the compnay guys, within 2 days of you calling them.I suggest you call them 2 days before the scheduled delivery date so that the delivery and isntallation can happen in one day itself. If AC installation is not a new thing to you, & if your wall does not have an ac pipe outlet from before, then I would also suggest getting your local guy to make a hole in the wall about 3-4 sq inches  to allow for the drain pipes, the coolant pipes and the connection wire to pass thru between the indoor and outdoor unit. Also think about the electric connection for the ac, how far it is from the AC, the need for a stabilizer &/or an isolation ELCB, etc.In short, the more you're prepared, the better and easier it will be , with fewer surprises.Of course, if you've got people to take care of these things, then you probably wont read this bit anyway. Its a good model, go for it.One minor gripe, the remote for this does not come with a wall cradle.. :/ those were quite handy!",Excellent product. Best cooling effect. iClean is a wonderful feature.

The AC was delivered on exactly the date and the time-slot I chose, which was pretty awesome.Re: Installation, apparently, the third-party Hitachi affiliated service folks are nearby my area itself, so it took them not more than 24 hours to send the technician for the installation. Took a while,4 hours or something to get everything up and running. It's been working flawlessly.NOTE : Installation for the AC was free for me, but doesn't apply to all the areas.P.S. NOTE: I brought the AC stand and Stabilizer from Hitachi itself, they have a tie up with a company in India called ""Ryoku"" or something. Quality stuff, but a bit pricey.Overall, I am loving it!

But to give what customer really wantThe discounts may only cover the price of installation so need to increase it.,I faced a lot of problem with AC Installation. I called Hitachi helpline number multiple time but they didn't picked up the call at all. I have to write lot of mails to amazon and Hitachi to get the work done.  Installation team was very rude and unprofessional and misguided us to have a drill on concrete and charges extra amount of money. Water outlet pipe was not given with the box (most others companies give the pipe) Instillation team forced us to purchase 12 feet pipe at 40 rupees (40*12=480 rupees) per feet cost (While market rate is just 100 rupees only). In short they are making a unprofessional business out of installation.
